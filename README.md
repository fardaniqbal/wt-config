My personal settings for Windows Terminal.  The files in this repo go
in the following directory for Windows Terminal to recognize it:

    %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<RANDOMNUMBER>\LocalState

Where `RANDOMNUMBER` would match whatever directory Windows Terminal
puts its settings in.  `%USERPROFILE%` should be automatically set by
windows to something like `C:\Users\yourusername`.
